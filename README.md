# Test-SWE-1

I'm trying to print the elements of a vector in reverse order using a simple for loop. The code compiles fine, but when I run it, the program sometimes crashes or outputs strange values.

I don’t understand what’s going wrong. I expected to see:

5
4
3
2
1

but instead, it crashes or prints garbage at the end.

Could it be some weird behavior with vectors or something related to memory?
